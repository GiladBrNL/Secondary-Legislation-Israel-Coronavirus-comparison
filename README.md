# Secondary-Legislation-Israel-Coronavirus-comparison
Comparison of three years of legislation in the secondary legislation department of the Ministry of Justice of Israel.
There is no objective way to measure the variabiltiy of efforts and outputs of legsilation as public officers are focused on input and not other measurable output.
This project tried to propose that an observable change in the size of the files in which regulations are stored is indivcative of a fundamental change in the operations of the team which write these regulations and can possible give rise to the conculstion that either more people were added to the team, or that the team has undergone processes for improvement of efficiency.

The method: Calculating the bytes of each file that contained secondary legislation.
